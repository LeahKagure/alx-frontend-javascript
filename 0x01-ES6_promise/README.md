0. **Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep** - Return a Promise using this prototype `function getResponseFromAPI()`
1. **Don't make a promise...if you know you can't keep it** - Using the prototype given, return a `promise`. The parameter is a `boolean`
2. **Catch me if you can!** - Using the given function prototype, append three handlers to the function
3. **Handle multiple successful promises** - In this file, import `uploadPhoto` and `createUser` from `utils.js`
4. **Simple promise** - Using the given prototype that returns a resolved promise with this object
5. **Reject the promises** - Write and export a function named `uploadPhoto`. It should accept one argument `fileName` (string). The function should return a Promise rejecting with an Error and the string `$fileName cannot be processed`
6. **Handle multiple promises** - Import `signUpUser` from `4-user-promises.js` and `uploadPhoto` from `5-photo-reject.js`. Write and export a function named `handleProfileSignup`. It should accept three arguments `firstName` (string), `lastName` (string), and `fileName` (string). The function should call the two other functions. When the promises are all settled it should return an array with the provided structure.
7. **Load balancer** - Write and export a function named `loadBalancer`. It should accept two arguments `chinaDownload` (Promise) and `USDownload` (Promise)
8. **Throw error/try catch** - Write a function named `divideFunction` that will accept two arguments: `numerator` (Number) and `denominator` (Number). When the `denominator` argument is equal to 0, the function should throw a new error with the message `cannot divide by 0`. Otherwise it should return the numerator divided by the denominator
9. **Throw an error** - Write a function named `guardrail` that will accept one argument `mathFunction` (Function). This function should create and return an array named `queue`. When the `mathFunction` function is executed, the value returned by the function should be appended to the queue. If this function throws an error, the error message should be appended to the queue. In every case, the message `Guardrail was processed` should be added to the queue
10. **Await/Async** - Import `uploadPhoto` and `createUser` from `utils.js`. Write an async function named `asyncUploadUser` that will call these two functions and return an object with the given format
